## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
### What I learned

Since this is my first challenge, I spent a bit of time to really understand the requirements. I was able to refresh my memory on CSS quite a lot.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="center">Some HTML code I'm proud of</div>
```
```css
.center {
  --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  background: var(--light-gray);
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
  margin: auto;
  position: absolute;
  text-align: center;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  border-radius: 8px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 8px var(--grayish-blue);
}
```
### Continued development

I plan to focus more on relative values when setting position elements and sizes. Also included in my plans are to clean up the code, simplify it and modify the media section of the CSS.
